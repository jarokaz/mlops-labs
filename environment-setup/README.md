# Setting up a reference MLOps environment

This folder contains the hands-on labs that guide you through the process of setting up a GCP based MLOps environment as depicted on the below diagram.

The core services in the environment are:
- ML experimentation and development - AI Platform Notebooks 
- Scalable, serverless model training - AI Platform Training  
- Scalable, serverless model serving - AI Platform Prediction 
- Distributed data processing - Dataflow  
- Analytics data warehouse - BigQuery 
- Artifact store - Google Cloud Storage 
- Machine learning pipelines - TensorFlow Extended (TFX) and Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)
- Machine learning metadata  management - ML Metadata on Cloud SQL
- CI/CD tooling - Cloud Build
    
In the environment, all services are provisioned in the same [Google Cloud Project](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects). 

The environment uses a [standalone deployment of Kubeflow Pipelines on GKE](https://www.kubeflow.org/docs/pipelines/installation/standalone-deployment/), as depicted on the below diagram:

The KFP services are deployed to the GKE cluster and configured to use the Cloud SQL managed MySQL instance for ML Metadata and GCS for artifact storage. The KFP services access the Cloud SQL through [Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy). External clients use [Inverting Proxy](https://github.com/google/inverting-proxy) to interact with the KFP services.

In the environment, an **AI Platform Notebooks** instance is configured using a custom container image that includes all packages required for KFP/TFX development.

Two set up the environment follow the instructions in two hands-on labs:
1. [Creating an AI Platform Notebooke instance](lab-01-env-setup-ai-notebook/README.md)
2. [Provisioning a standalone deployment of Kubeflow Pipelines](lab-02-env-setup-kfp/README.md)
