# Setting up a reference MLOps environment

This folder contains the hands-on labs that guide you through the process of setting up a reference MLOps environment depicted on the below diagram.

The core services in the environment are:
- ML experimentation and development - AI Platform Notebooks 
- Scalable, serverless model training - AI Platform Training  
- Scalable, serverless model serving - AI Platform Prediction 
- Distributed data processing - Dataflow  
- Analytics data warehouse - BigQuery 
- Artifact store - Google Cloud Storage 
- Machine learning pipelines - TensorFlow Extended (TFX) and Kubeflow Pipelines (KFP)
- Machine learning metadata  management - ML Metadata on Cloud SQL
- CI/CD tooling - Cloud Build
    
In the reference lab environment, all services are provisioned in the same [Google Cloud Project](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/projects). 

The environment uses a lightweight deployment of Kubeflow Pipelines on GKE, as depicted on the below diagram:

The deployment includes:
- A VPC to host GKE cluster
- A GKE cluster to host KFP services
- A Cloud SQL managed MySQL instance to host KFP and ML Metadata databases
- A Cloud Storage bucket to host artifact repository

The KFP services are deployed to the GKE cluster and configured to use the Cloud SQL managed MySQL instance. The KFP services access the Cloud SQL through [Cloud SQL Proxy](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/sql-proxy). External clients use [Inverting Proxy](https://github.com/google/inverting-proxy) to interact with the KFP services.
