# TFX Components walk-through

In this lab, you will walk through  the configuration and execution of the key TFX components. The primary goal of the lab is to get a high level understanding of the function and usage of each of the components. You will work in a Jupyter notebook using the components in an interactive mode.


## Lab instructions

Follow the instructor who will guide you through the `tfx-walkthrough.ipynb` notebook.

**IMPORTANT**

Currently, TFMA visualizations do not render properly in JupyterLab. It is recommended to run the lab notebook in Jupyter Classic Notebook. To switch to Classic Notebook select *Launch Classic Notebook* from the *Help* menu.
