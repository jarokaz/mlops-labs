# TFX Components walk-through

In this lab, you will walk through  configuration and execution of key TFX Components. The primary goal of the lab is to get a high level understanding of the function and usage of each of the components. You will work in a Jupyter notebook using TFX Components in an interactive mode to analyze and prepare data, and to train and deploy a TensorFlow model.


## Lab instructions

Follow the instructor who will guide you through the `tfx-walkthrough.ipynb` notebook.

**IMPORTANT**

Currently, TFMA visualizations do not render properly in JupyterLab. It is recommended to run the lab notebook in Jupyter Classic Notebook. To switch to Classic Notebook select *Launch Classic Notebook* from the *Help* menu.
