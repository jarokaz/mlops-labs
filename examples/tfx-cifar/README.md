# CIFAR 10 Example

The CIFAR 10 example demonstrates the continuous training TFX pipeline that trains an image classification model on CIFAR10 dataset. The pipeline runs on a standalone deployment of Kubeflow Pipelines on GKE and uses Cloud Dataflow and Cloud AI Platform Training as compute runtimes for data validation and transformation and model training and analysis.

## The dataset

This example uses the
[CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) released by the
The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).

## Lab environment setup
To build and deploy the pipeline you need a workstation with the Python KFP and TFX SDKs and a Hosted Pipelines environment. 

You can find the instructions how to create an instance of **AI Platform Notebooks** with the KFP and TFX SDKs pre-installed and how to provision the KFP environment in the [environment setup](../../environment-setup) section of this repo.

Alternatively, you can provision the Hosted Pipelines environment using  using [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/clusters). If you go this route you also need to create a GCS bucket that will be used to store artifacts used and created by the pipeline.



## Configuring the environment settings
You will use TFX CLI to compile and deploy the pipeline. The pipeline DSL retrieves the compile time settings from a set of environment variables. Before attempting to compile the pipeline you need to set these variables. 


```
export PROJECT_ID=[YOUR PROJECT ID]
export GKE_CLUSTER_NAME=[YOUR KFP CLUSTER NAMESPACE]
export NAMESPACE=[NAMESPACE WHERE KFP IS INSTALLED]
export GCP_REGION=[YOUR REGION]
export ZONE=[ZONE OF YOUR GKE CLUSTER]
export ARTIFACT_STORE_URI=[YOUR GCS BUCKET]

export GCS_STAGING_PATH=${ARTIFACT_STORE_URI}/staging
export DATA_ROOT_URI=gs://workshop-datasets/cifar10

gcloud container clusters get-credentials $GKE_CLUSTER_NAME --zone $ZONE
export INVERSE_PROXY_HOSTNAME=$(kubectl describe configmap inverse-proxy-config -n $NAMESPACE | grep "googleusercontent.com")
export TFX_IMAGE=gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/custom_tfx_cifar10:latest

export PIPELINE_NAME=cifar10_continuous_training

```


## Building and deploying the pipeline

You can build and upload the pipeline to the KFP environment in one step, using the `tfx pipeline create` command. The `tfx pipeline create` goes through the following steps:
- (Optional) Builds an image to host your components, 
- Compiles the pipeline DSL into a pipeline package 
- Uploads the pipeline package to the KFP environment.

As you are debugging the pipeline DSL, you may prefer to first use the `tfx pipeline compile` command, which only executes the compilation step. After the DSL compiles successfully you can use `tfx pipeline create` to go through all steps.

To compile the DSL
```
tfx pipeline compile --engine kubeflow --pipeline_path pipeline/pipeline.py
```
This command creates a pipeline package named `${PIPELINE_NAME}.tar.gz`. The package containes the `pipeline.yaml` file that is a Kubeflow Pipelines YAML specification of the pipeline. 

To inspect the YAML specification extract the `pipeline.yaml` file from the tar archive and view the file in the JupyterLab editor.
```
tar xvf ${PIPELINE_NAME}.tar.gz
```

To build and upload the pipeline to the KFP environment use the `tfx pipeline create` command. Note that in this lab, the command is configured to use **Cloud Build** to build the image and push it to your project's **Container Registry**. This is set in the `build.yaml` file. TFX CLI uses [skaffold](https://skaffold.dev/) for the build step and `build.yaml` uses the build section of the full [`skaffold.yaml`](https://skaffold.dev/docs/design/config/) configuration.

Before executing the `tfx pipeline create` command, modify the `image` field of the `build.yaml` file so it references your project. 
```
SED_SCRIPT='s/\([[:blank:]]*image:[[:blank:]]*\).*/\1gcr\.io\/'$PROJECT_ID'\/custom_tfx/'
sed -i $SED_SCRIPT build.yaml
```

```
tfx pipeline create --engine kubeflow --pipeline_path pipeline/pipeline.py --endpoint $INVERSE_PROXY_HOSTNAME
```



### Submitting and monitoring pipeline runs

After the pipeline has been deployed, you can trigger and monitor pipeline runs using **TFX CLI** or **KFP UI**.

To submit the pipeline run using **TFX CLI**:
```
tfx run create --pipeline_name $PIPELINE_NAME --endpoint $INVERSE_PROXY_HOSTNAME
```

To list all the active runs of the pipeline:
```
tfx run list --pipeline_name $PIPELINE_NAME --endpoint $INVERSE_PROXY_HOSTNAME
```

To retrieve the status of a given run:
```
tfx run status --pipeline_name $PIPELINE_NAME --run_id [YOUR_RUN_ID] --endpoint $INVERSE_PROXY_HOSTNAME
```
 To terminate a run:
 ```
 tfx run terminate --run_id [YOUR_RUN_ID] --endpoint $INVERSE_PROXY_HOSTNAME
 ```
### Deleting the pipeline
You can delete the pipeline from the KFP environment using the `tfx pipeline delete` command.
```
tfx pipeline delete --pipeline_name $PIPELINE_NAME --endpoint $INVERSE_PROXY_HOSTNAME
```
