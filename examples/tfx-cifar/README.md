# CIFAR 10 Example

This example demonstrates a continuous training TFX pipeline that trains an image classification model on CIFAR10 dataset. The pipeline runs on **AI Platform Pipelines**  and uses **Cloud Dataflow** and **Cloud AI Platform Training and Prediction** as as execution runtimes.

## The dataset

This example uses the
[CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) released by the
The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).

Note: This site provides applications using data that has been modified for use
from its original source, The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).
The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) makes no claims as to the

## Environment setup
To build, deploy, and run the pipeline you need an instance of **AI Platform Notebooks**  and an **AI Platform Pipelines** environment. 

Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/create-new) to provision the **AI Platform Notebooks** instance. Use the TensorFlow 2.1 image.

Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs/setting-up) to provision the **AI Platform Pipelines** environment.
