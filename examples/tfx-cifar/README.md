# CIFAR 10 Example

The CIFAR 10 example demonstrates the continuous training TFX pipeline that trains an image classification model on CIFAR10 dataset. The pipeline runs on a standalone deployment of Kubeflow Pipelines on GKE and uses Cloud Dataflow and Cloud AI Platform Training as compute runtimes for data validation and transformation and model training and analysis.

## The dataset

This example uses the
[CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) released by the
The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).

## Environment setup
To build, deploy, and run the pipeline you need an instance of **AI Platform Notebooks**  and an **AI Platform Pipelines** environment. 

Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs/setting-up) to provision the **AI Platform Notebooks** instance. Use the TensorFlow 2.1 image.

Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/create-new) to provision the **AI Platform Pipelines** environment.
