# CIFAR10 Classifier Example

This example demonstrates a continuous training TFX pipeline that trains an image classification model on CIFAR10 dataset. The pipeline runs on **AI Platform Pipelines**  and uses **Cloud Dataflow** and **Cloud AI Platform Training and Prediction** as as execution runtimes.

## The dataset

This example uses the
[CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) released by the
The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).

## Setting up the environment
To run the example, you need an instance of **AI Platform Notebooks**  and an **AI Platform Pipelines** environment. 

Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/create-new) to provision the **AI Platform Notebooks** instance. Use the TensorFlow 2.1 image.

Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs/setting-up) to provision the **AI Platform Pipelines** environment.

## Running the example
To run the example:
1. Connect to **JupyterLab** on your **AI Platform Notebooks** instance.
2. Open the **JupyterLab** terminal.
3. Clone this repo in the home folder.
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/jarokaz/mlops-labs.git
