# CIFAR10 Classifier Example

This example demonstrates a continuous training TFX pipeline that trains an image classification model on CIFAR10 dataset. The pipeline runs on **AI Platform Pipelines**  and uses **Cloud Dataflow** and **Cloud AI Platform Training and Prediction** as as execution runtimes.

## The dataset

This example uses the
[CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) released by the
The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).

Note: This site provides applications using data that has been modified for use
from its original source, The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR).
The Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR) makes no claims as to the

You can read more about the dataset in
[CIFAR dataset homepage](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html).


## Setting up the environment
To run the example, you need to enable the required cloud services and provision an instance of **AI Platform Notebooks** and an instance **AI Platform Pipelines**.

### Enabling services
To enable the services required by the sample.
1. Launch [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/launching-cloud-shell)
2. Set your project ID
```
PROJECT_ID=[YOUR PROJECT ID]

gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```
3. Enable the services
```
gcloud services enable \
container.googleapis.com \
iam.googleapis.com \
containerregistry.googleapis.com \
containeranalysis.googleapis.com \
ml.googleapis.com \
dataflow.googleapis.com
```


### Provisioning an instance of **AI Platform Notebooks**
Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/notebooks/docs/create-new) to provision the **AI Platform Notebooks** instance. Use the TensorFlow 2.1 image.

### Provisioning an instance of **AI Platform Pipelines**
Follow [this instructions](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/pipelines/docs/setting-up) to provision the **AI Platform Pipelines** environment.

## Running the example
To run the example:
1. Connect to **JupyterLab** on your **AI Platform Notebooks** instance.
2. Open the **JupyterLab** terminal.
3. Clone this repo in the home folder.
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/jarokaz/mlops-labs.git
```
4. Run the `install.sh` script from the `mlops-labs/examples/tfx-cifar` folder. The script installs TFX and KFP SDKs and creates a GCS bucket to be used as an artifact store.
5. Open and walk through the `cifar10-tfx.ipynb` notebook in the `mlops-labs/examples/tfx-cifar` folder.
